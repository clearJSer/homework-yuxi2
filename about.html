    <p>The web is a big place. Think about how one sifts through it all, in ways that help us learn and connect. How do we *save* things from this vast repository? How do we *organize* things within its systems? How do we *prioritize* (or deprioritize) what we have found? How does one make *sense* of it all?</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
    The web is also inherently a community. This community is built, in large part, upon tools that facilitate interaction, collaboration, and rearrangement. The tools (and thus the community) have structures of their own, which one can work with, or against. Think of the ways you can use these tools for their utility, within their limitations. Think also of how you can use them to connect and to collaborate.
